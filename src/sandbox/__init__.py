"""Sandbox package - LangGraph testing environment.

This package contains experimental code and proof-of-concept implementations
for testing LangGraph patterns and agent behaviors before integration into the
main CodeDueProcess system.

Components:
- agent.py: Multi-agent workflow (Supervisor, Researcher, Analyst)
- tools.py: Mock tools for demonstration
- config.py: Environment configuration
- cache.py: Custom SQLite cache for LLM responses
- main.py: Entry point and examples

This is a testing ground - the actual CodeDueProcess implementation will be
in the 'codedueprocess' package.
